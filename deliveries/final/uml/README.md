UML
===

The folders `client` and `server` contains the complete UML (with some approximations
to keep it readable). It was edited with [Umbrello](https://umbrello.kde.org/).

We recommend opening the HTML file to view the UML.

A smaller UML illustrates the Server, expecially its model, is `uml_riassuntivo.png`.
